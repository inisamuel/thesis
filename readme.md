## Symbolic Representation of Time Series Data using VAEs with Discrete Latent Variables

### Summary

We aim to learn symbolic representations of time series data in an unsupervised manner using 
variational autoencoders (VAEs) with categorical latent variables + Gumbel-softmax reparametrization

MLFlow is used to log metrics, parameters and artefacts, and the runs are saved in
