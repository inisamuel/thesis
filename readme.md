## Discrete Representation of Time Series Data using VAE with Discrete Latent Variables

### Summary


### Todos 

- plot binary with time series together, replicate plot dari folie
- enc, dec: 1d convolution, lstm
- multivariate bernoulli
- variable #bits and #symbols
- model encode per patch
- piecewiese linear methods (e.g. PAA)
- normalization -> time series scale
- additional "magnitude"+"shift" word? -> dependent on downstream tasks
- ensemble method to encode differnet attributes using differnt vaes
- see if similar patches result in similar binary codes
- generalization to other datasets
- slides before meetings -> plots
- baseline -> cluster binary codes , time series patches
- weights for kl-div (beta-vae)
- cat_kl_div -> default params di vae class
- Experiment management (wandb, mlflow)
